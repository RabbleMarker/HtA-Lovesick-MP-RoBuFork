# HtA-Lovesick-MP

Initial Release, still needs more optimizations done to make the game run less like shit (remove unneeded tags, consolidate religions) but it should be mostly playable now.

Based on Demonade's MP HtA edit and specifically the Dempsey edit, the mod is intended to make HtA actually fucking playable in MP by fixing the fucked Eco and balancing it out to make the gameplay more interesting.

The initial releases will focus on stability and some minor changes to promote healthier gameplay, later the mod will shift into adding new decisions, events, and paths for nations to flesh them out even more.

General Changes: 

* Added a proper World Bank based on how it works in IGOR.
* Fixed Ghost Nation so it actually Checks for all the new tags.
* Pop rebalances: 
	* Slight buff to nu-world since they start depopulated as fuck in this mod (20%, only new world cultures Natives are untouched). 
	* Nerfed Japanese starting Pop (-20%, puts them even with most mods, plus they get a fucking babyboom in Korea so they should be fine). 
	* Genocided the remaining China and Manchu pops who didn't get caught in the initial Demonade pass (30%)
	* Nerfed Indian pops to 60%.
* Rebalanced RGOs and Factories around the world, took notes from PUIR and also some DoD mods to spread RGOs out so relevant nations aren't completely cucked. Production should be comparable to PUIR levels of important goods and the world starts off much more industrialized.
* Starting OOB for all nations touched up and added more sizable navies to relevant naval nations.
* Added Tech to relevant nations so the entire world doesn't start without fucking railroads or cheap coal. This drastically improved the eco and probably was the biggest issue with the vanilla mod.
* Removed unneeded events like the ebin chinese civil war that auto civilizes Qin (why the fuck was this in the game)
* Gave all Uncivs the Persian Conquest RP nerf (-25% conquest RP) which is now a triggered modifier (the event was broken and would endlessly trigger if Persia civilized anyway).
* Cultures merged or fixed, referencing the actual L O R E of the HtA setting where the creator fucked up and forgot to change it (like Afro-Latino in colonies Spain never owned or colonized).
* Added starting Spheres and Alliances where they made sense or influence so a country can get sphered quickly if the player wants to.
* Added working Treaty Ports
	* Made the Dutch's Treaty Port in Japan an actual Treaty Port so they have a reason to hold onto it. If Japan takes it back the treaty port is destroyed though, although they get a buff for doing so.
* Removed all the retarded African cores in uncolonized provinces.
* Added missing colonies in Afrika (starting colonies) from the original mod.
* Consolidated regions across the map where it made sense and added or removed straits so some countries can get connected.
* Nerfed" Scandinavia by removing Ugrian and giving them Lithuanian and Prussian instead.


Changes by Country:

Russia & Smolensk:
	* Added a Debuff during Civil War which makes it more painful even if you fight AI. Goes away after the war ends and you form.
	* Fixed issues with Smolensk not getting any of the decisions or events Russia should.
	* Rebalanced Ugrian Pop spread so there's about the same amount of them as Tartar
	* RUS can't get Tartar anymore so which nation wins will affect your accepted, but both should be about even due to the above.
	* To make up for the above they get even better RGOs, although these are in the direct path of Finland and Zachadia
	* Buffed Russian and Smolensk OOB, they likely will lose all these soldiers in the bobo war anyway this just probably makes the civil war worse for them.
	* Peasant reform now gives Russia or Smolensk Ashkenazi.
	* Fixed all of Siberia being 300 soldiers (this will be accomplished with a random Siberian Republic tag spawning, taking the uncolonized land, and then nuking itself) 
	* Siberia pops buffed up and now once Siberia is fully colonized Russia will get a 'Siberian Breadbasket' which extends to Perm and Samara.

Germany:
	* Each contender now has their own paths and split the vanilla PUIR decisions between them (Brandenburg gets Prussian focused ones like von molt, Brunswick gets Ruhr boom, Bavaria get some Austrian and South German focused ones).
	* Brandenburg is now the only contender who can get Silesian and Prusai accepted, they also get Ashkenazi accepted (this may be adjusted if it's too strong).
	* Brunswick can accept Steenkooler (Ebin Frisian/German Sudafrika) and take the SAF related decisions.
	* Bavaria now starts with Romansh accepted (majority in Helvetica) and if they form Germany they can buff the LR of Helvetica and Austria to 38. They also can accept Slovene.
	* Reworked how NGF and SGF works (can form NGF at Ideological thought, SGF at State n Gov but can do it quicker if NGF already exists, can now form GER, SGF, and NGF by puppeting alone.
France:
	* Gets a decision to reclaim Gidan and core and accept Afro Antillean
	* Industry heavily buffed
Aquitania:
	* Added the actual point of the entire mod: The Aquitanian Revoltion. It's just a minor starting decision that allows you to go Republican or keep the Monarchy. Their parties are buffed to make being a Republic not that bad and they also get some further decisions. If you go Republic you lose your colonies however.
	* They can get Romansh cored and accepted as well (is now all of Helvetica)
Byzantium & Armenia:
	* Reworked the Anatole Baby Boom, it's now a triggered decision buff instead of an event that applies to a smaller part, but lasts longer
	* Reworked the Rum decisions, they now no longer get Greek or Georgian, but they can get Tartar instead.
	* Byzantine gets Georgian and can also now abandon their Roman ambitions and take an alternative path, reusing decisions from the vanilla mod.
Nanyue:
	* Now locked into doing their Indochina path, and no longer a retarded event chain.
Aengland:
	* Can get Danish accepted now
Celtic Federation:
	* Can get Picard and Breton.
